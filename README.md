# Portfolio2.0

# This was my first portfolio - my new and updated portfolio can be seen pinned on my Github board!

Hello! Welcome to my Professional Portfolio

You may find that there is more design and layout put into this portfolio than actual examples of projects completed. This is because this is actually my first project! The first thing I've ever developed - how fun! ** I have created a new 2.0 version with updated design

The user should expect to see:

A Professional Portfolio displaying my name, a picture of myself, and a nav bar linkning to sections of my webpage.

An about me section that shares just a little bit about myself.

A work section that (while currently has placeholders) will show prospective projects I've completed.

A carefully thought out layout to help ease the user's experience and have a natural flow of the page.

Lastly, a contact section where potential employers and developers could reach me in the future! (Also placeholders)

Below is a screenshot of what the user can expect:
